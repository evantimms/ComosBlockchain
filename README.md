# Comos Blockchain

Cosmos is a platform designed to support what they are calling 'an internet of blockchains'. Bascially, anyone can use Comos's API to 
create their very own block chain that operates on the network. These coins are scalable due to a new proof-of-stake validation engine
developed by Cosmos, and are interoperable, meaning blockchains on the network are siloed and cannote communicate with eachother.

This repo represents a small coin I build using the Cosmos SDK to demonstrate the ease of creating a full scalable blockchain on 
the Cosmos Network.
